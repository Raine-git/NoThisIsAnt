# Hello there! üëãüèª
I'm not sure what brought you here, I'm not even sure how you found this GitHub thing, but anyways...
I don't plan on actually using this, I created this account back when I had some... abitious dreams about creating some stuff, let's just say, and I think you and I could safely assume that is not going to happen, but I have tried, once, and failed miserably, who knows, maybe I will try again in the future, don't get your hopes high though.

To populate this section, might as well add an "about me" sort of thing.

## Who am I?
I'm Raine, no, I'm not going to tell you my full name, or age, maybe when we become friends, but yeah, I'm just a regular, boring person who tries to do random stuff here and there, thanks to ADHD. I have an associate's degree in Electrical Engineering, can get quite useful at times, but I'd admit, I forgot most of them by now.

And one unfortunate thing, I'm sadly British.

## What do I do?
As I said, I'm just a regular, boring person, but if you wanted more insight, here ya go; I work a full time job, I watch YouTube, and TikTok, most of them are Taylor Swift memes, I also listen to music, a lot of music, mostly Taylor Swift, oh, and I don't watch shows a lot, but my favourite series is "13 Reasons Why". I am also a part-time artist, an unmotivated one at that, I drew my profile picture!
